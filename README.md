# Machine-Learning
In this project I have used Support Vector Machine to predict the stock price of Apple Inc(AAPL). 
The data was downloaded from Yahoo Finanace and is a real life stock data.
This is the first Machine Learning project that I built on my own.
As the Stock Market opens and closes everyday, the values used in the dataset may age in some time.
So, here is a link for the source of the upto date dataset.
